# TeaPacket
This repository is a partial rewrite of my last revision of the TeaPacket game engine.

This is updated infrequently and in random pockets of spare time. Do not expect anything crazy, substantial, or even functional yet. It is not one of my current active projects.

Go see my previous TeaPacket repository for more info.

Make sure you run `prebuild.py` before compiling anything. Building using the CMakeLists.txt in the root directory is reccomended but not required (ensure that TEAPACKET_ROOT is set to the root directory though.)
